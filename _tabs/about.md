# About Me

I work in networking, but I've recently started exploring DevOps, Development, and ways to automate my workflow. In my free time, I love learning and building useful tools. While I still have a lot to learn, I'm always on the lookout for tips and advice to improve.

- I'm fairly new to Git, so I'm bound to run into some issues as I get the hang of it.

## Purpose of This Page

- I've noticed that small issues can take up a lot of time, so I created this blog to share interesting discoveries and time-saving guides.
- This blog also serves as a place to document my overall learning journey.
- Also to share topics I find interesting.

So far, I've focused on Networking, OSINT, Python, and Linux, but I'm eager to expand my skills as I continue to learn.
