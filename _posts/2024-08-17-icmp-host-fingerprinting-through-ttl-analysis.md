# ICMP Host Fingerprinting Through TTL Analysis

### ICMP isn’t just for ping and traceroute; it’s also a valuable tool in security research.

- **TTL (Time to Live)**: A field in the IP header that indicates how many hops (routers) a packet can traverse before being discarded.
    - Each router decreases the TTL by 1.
    - If TTL hits zero, the packet is dropped, and an ICMP "Time Exceeded" message is returned.
- **How TTL Helps Identify Hosts**
    - When pinging a device, the TTL value in the reply can provide insights into the host’s operating system or device type.
    - Different systems have unique default TTL values, helping you identify the device.

### Common Default TTL Values
- **Linux**: TTL = 64
- **Windows**: TTL = 128
- **Cisco Devices**: TTL = 255

### Calculating the Original TTL

To identify the original TTL of the host, you need to consider the number of hops between your device and the target. Here's a simple method to estimate the original TTL:

1. **Ping the Host**: Send an ICMP echo request to the host and note the TTL value in the reply.
2. **Calculate the Number of Hops**: Perform a `traceroute` to the host to determine the number of hops (routers) between you and the target.
3. **Estimate the Original TTL**: Add the number of hops to the TTL value in the reply. This sum will give you the original TTL that the host likely used.

### Step-by-Step Example of Device Fingerprinting:

#### 1. **Ping the Host**

First, send an ICMP echo request to the host and note the TTL value in the reply.
```ps
Pinging 192.168.12.1 with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 192.168.12.1: bytes=32 time=1ms TTL=63
```
- Here, you received a TTL value of **63**.

#### 2. **Determine the Number of Hops**

Next, use `traceroute` to find the number of hops (routers) between your device and the target host.
```ps
> tracert -d 192.168.12.1
Tracing route to 192.168.12.1 over a maximum of 30 hops

  1    <1 ms    <1 ms    <1 ms  192.168.1.1
  2     1 ms    <1 ms    <1 ms  192.168.12.1

Trace complete.
```
- The `traceroute` shows that the host is **1 hop** away.

#### 3. **Estimate the Original TTL**

Now, add the number of hops to the TTL value from the ping reply. This sum gives you an estimate of the original TTL value set by the host.

Calculation:
```plaintext
Original TTL = Received TTL + Hop Count
             = 63 + 1
             = 64
```
- The original TTL is likely **64**, letting us know this is most likely a Linux-based system.

### Example 2: Multiple Hops

If you ping a device and receive a TTL of **118**, and `traceroute` shows the host is **10 hops** away:

Calculation:
```plaintext
Original TTL = 118 + 10 = 128
```
- In this case, the original TTL is likely **128**, indicating the host is probably running a Windows-based system.
