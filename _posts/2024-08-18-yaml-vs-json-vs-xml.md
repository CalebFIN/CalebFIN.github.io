A Quick Guide and Cheatsheet for Programmatically Storing Data

## Overview

Data within these formats share several common traits:

- Structured for Code
- Annotated for Humans
- Open Source
- Platform Agnostic
- Describes its own data

## Feature Comparison


| Feature                | YAML                                  | JSON                                      | XML                                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Readability**        | Very readable                         | Readable                                  | Less readable; verbose syntax                 |
| **Data Types**         | Strings, numbers, lists, associative arrays | Objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, null | Wide range via schemas                       |
| **Comments**           | Supported                             | Not supported                             | Supported                                     |
| **Hierarchy**          | Indentation                           | Braces and brackets                       | Tags and attributes                           |
| **Extension**          | `.yaml` or `.yml`                     | `.json`                                   | `.xml`                                        |
| **Metadata**           | Limited via tags                      | No direct support                         | Extensive via attributes/namespaces           |
| **Parsing**            | Requires libraries                    | Native in most languages                  | Requires libraries                            |
| **Common Use Cases**   | Config files, simple data             | Web APIs, data exchange                   | Complex structures, legacy systems            |
| **Error Tolerance**    | More tolerant, flexible               | Less tolerant, strict syntax              | Less tolerant, strict syntax                  |

## XML

- **Legacy Support**: XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is often used in older systems and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) APIs.
- **Verbose Syntax**: XML can be less readable due to its extensive use of tags and attributes.
- **Strong Metadata Support**: XML allows for complex data structures with extensive support for attributes and namespaces.

## JSON

- **Popular**: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is widely used, especially in web development.
- **Lightweight**: JSON is compact and easy to parse, making it ideal for data interchange between servers and web applications.
- **Native to JavaScript**: JSON is the default format for data in JavaScript environments.

## YAML

- **Highly Readable**: YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is designed to be human-readable, using indentation to define structure.
- **Compact**: YAML files are often smaller and more straightforward than their JSON or XML counterparts, making them ideal for configuration files.
- **Flexible**: YAML's syntax allows for easy editing and error tolerance, making it a favorite for DevOps and configuration management.
