A Quick Guide and Cheatsheet for Programmatically Storing Data

## Overview

Data within these formats share several common traits:

- Structured for Code
- Annotated for Humans
- Open Source
- Platform Agnostic
- Describes its own data

## Feature Comparison

| Feature                | YAML                                  | JSON                                      | XML                                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Human Readability**  | Very readable                         | Readable                                  | Less readable due to verbose syntax           |
| **Data Formats**       | Supports strings, numbers, lists, and associative arrays | Supports objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and null | Supports a wide range of data types through schemas |
| **Comments**           | Supports comments                     | Does not support comments                 | Supports comments                             |
| **Hierarchy**          | Indentation                           | Braces and brackets                       | Tags and attributes                           |
| **File Extension**     | `.yaml` or `.yml`                     | `.json`                                   | `.xml`                                        |
| **Support for Metadata** | Limited support through tags         | No direct support                         | Extensive support through attributes and namespaces |
| **Parsing**            | Generally requires external libraries (though widely available) | Native support in most programming languages | Requires external libraries (though widely available) |
| **APIs and Config Files** | Commonly used in configuration files and less often in APIs | Widely used in web APIs                    | Used in legacy systems, SOAP APIs, and configurations where metadata is important |
| **Error Tolerance**    | More tolerant due to its readability and flexibility | Less tolerant to errors; strict syntax    | Less tolerant; strict syntax but can be more complex to parse correctly |
| **Use Cases**          | Configuration files, simpler data serialization | Web APIs, data interchange between server and web applications | Complex data structures, document markup, legacy systems |

## XML

- **Legacy Support**: XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is often used in older systems and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) APIs.
- **Verbose Syntax**: XML can be less readable due to its extensive use of tags and attributes.
- **Strong Metadata Support**: XML allows for complex data structures with extensive support for attributes and namespaces.

## JSON

- **Popular**: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is widely used, especially in web development.
- **Lightweight**: JSON is compact and easy to parse, making it ideal for data interchange between servers and web applications.
- **Native to JavaScript**: JSON is the default format for data in JavaScript environments.

## YAML

- **Highly Readable**: YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is designed to be human-readable, using indentation to define structure.
- **Compact**: YAML files are often smaller and more straightforward than their JSON or XML counterparts, making them ideal for configuration files.
- **Flexible**: YAML's syntax allows for easy editing and error tolerance, making it a favorite for DevOps and configuration management.
