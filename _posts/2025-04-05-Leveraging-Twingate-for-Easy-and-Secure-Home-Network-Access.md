A little while back, I decided it was time to finally set up a simple and secure way to reach my home network from anywhere. I’ve got a Raspberry Pi doing all the usual stuff DNS, NAS, ETC.

I wanted access on the go without punching holes in my router or exposing anything to the internet.

### What is Twingate and Why Use It?

Twingate is basically a secure tunnel into any network you can host a connector on.

For home users it's free with the base set of features.

### How I Set It Up

**Step 1: Registering for Twingate**  Their onboarding process is straightforward. You can sign in with Google, Microsoft, GitHub, and other identity providers, making the setup simple for OAuth from the get-go.

**Step 2: Deploying the Connector**
I dropped the Connector on my Raspberry Pi (which is always on anyway). It acts as a bridge between my home network and Twingate’s access point. They’ve got Docker containers and CLI scripts that make deployment super quick — it honestly took just a few minutes.

**Step 4: Installing the Client** Finally, I installed the Twingate client on my phone and connected

### Benefits I’ve Noticed

- **No open ports**: I didn’t need to modify my router or expose any services to the web.
    
- **Zero configuration changes to my internal network**: Everything runs behind NAT like normal.
    
- **Logs and traffic monitoring**: Twingate provides simple traffic logs so I can see what devices connected and when.
